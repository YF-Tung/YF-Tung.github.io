Yu-Fan Tung's homepage is this!

Bio
======
Interested in computer science, I entered [Taiwan Evolutionary Intelligence Lab](http://teilab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/#/home) to pursue my master degree in 2013. Aside from enthusiasm for software development and design, I also keep an eye on latest machine learning breakthroughs and actively find good ideas from them.

Work Experience
======
* Software Engineer at [VisualOn Inc.](https://www.visualon.com) (Present)
* Contractor at U Friend Inc.

Side Projects
======
Other than contributing to well-known projects, here are some of my personal projects.
* Ptt Analyzer [GitHub](https://github.com/YF-Tung/PTT_Analyzer)
  Based on collaborative filtering of user behavior across multiple bulletin boards, it recommends other boards that one might be interested in.

* Domain Name Checker [GitHub](https://github.com/YF-Tung/domain-name-checker)
  A background service that periodically checks whether a domain name is still pointing to what you expecting. I'm using this along with [CertWatcher](https://github.com/YF-Tung/certwatcher).

Trivia
======
Some trivia about me:

* I truly don't know whether I'm a Scorpio or Libra. The ambiguity makes me really don't care about the horoscope things.
* I don't have much physical talents except sense of balance. I never fall!
